service worker caches files  that ends with   /.*\.(?:js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|svg|webp|woff2?|ttf|otf|eot|ico|gif)/, and that includes javascript files and css files all type of images and all type of fonts


1-manifest file and sw file need to be in the last scope of the project so it will access all files that need to be cached
2-pwajs file  needs  to be called in all html pages     <script src="../js/pwajs.js" type="module"> </script>
3-manifest file needs to be called in all html pages in the head section     <link rel="manifest" href="../manifest.json">
4-you need to change the next from the files so it works well 
   a- the manifest file :  1- the information about the app like name, short_name , description and icons_url should change to match the application 
		  2-  the start_url is the path that the downloaded app will open at also change to match
		  3- dispaly stay the same 
		  4- change theme color and backgroundcolor to suit the app
  b- sw file : 1- url
  c- pwajs :	 2- the url of sw
